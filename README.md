# ory-editor-plugins

This is a monorepo for all plugins for the [Ory Editor](https://github.com/ory/editor) created for the E-Learning Website [www.serlo.org](https://de.serlo.org).

## Run the storybook

To run the storybook, run the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

After that open [http://localhost:9009](http://localhost:9009) in your browser.

## Adding new plugins

### File structure

To add a new plugin you create a folder in `plugins/layout` for LayoutPlugins or `plugins/content` for ContentPlugins
(details for these types are documented by ORY in the [User Guide on gitbook](https://ory.gitbooks.io/editor/content/#how-it-works).)

In the folder you need a few things (they can be copied as templates from the folder `plugins/template`:

* `package.json`: with `name` as used for import, `"version": "0.0.0"` (so it is resolved correctly by `lerna`), scripts as in the other plugins and `peerDependencies` to `react` and `react-dom`
* `README.md`: with the package name for later npm export
* `src` folder with the source files for the plugin.

### Test new plugins in the example

Firstly, import your plugin in `.storybook/helpers/Renderer.js` and add it to `const plugins`. You can then use the plugin in any of the existing stories and add additional stories in your `src/index.stories.js` file.

## FAQ

### Where can I learn more about creating Ory plugins?

There is a great tutorial provided in the [User guide on gitbook](https://ory.gitbooks.io/editor/content/tutorials.html#reactjs-example).

### How should I persist changes?

All plugins receive `this.props.state` and `this.props.onChange(...)`. You should get all values using the `state` supplied via `props` and persist all attributes needed using the mentioned `onChange(...)`.

#### Example

```
handleValueChange(event) {
    const target = event.target
    //in case the event is fired by a checkbox we need to deal with it differently
    const value = target.type === 'checkbox' ? target.checked : target.value
    const name = target.name

    this.props.onChange({
        [name]: value
    })
}
```

Notice the ES6 shorthand here.
You can then use the saved values like this:

```
const { state } = this.props
const foo = state.foo || 'default value'
```

### What does Lerna do?

Lerna is a tool to manage multiple packages in one repository. (In our case the multiple packages are yarn workspaces defined in the `package.json`). We want to be able to import every plugin on its own, so we need a tool which links the different packages together.
This is where Lerna comes into play. It automatically resolves local packages in the dependencies and and links them correctly, so they can be imported and handled like any published npm package (e.g without knowledge about the file structure).
Lerna also provides the possibility to run a script in all packages, so `lerna run build:watch` executes the `build:watch` script in every package, so you don't have to call them all by yourself.
